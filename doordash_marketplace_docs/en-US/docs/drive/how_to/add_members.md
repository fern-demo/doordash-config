# Add members to your organization

Adding members to your organization helps you collaborate with the other developers on your team by sharing access to the [Delivery Simulator](/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/use_delivery_simulator), to your [credentials](/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/manage_credentials), to your [webhook configurations](/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/webhooks).

## 1. Navigate to the members list[​](#1-navigate-to-the-members-list "Direct link to heading")

Enter your teammate's email address, select a role for them, and click Add Member.

Your teammate must already have a DoorDash identity. If they don't, have them sign up at [developer.doordash.com/signup](https://developer.doordash.com/signup) and then come back to the Add Member screen.
