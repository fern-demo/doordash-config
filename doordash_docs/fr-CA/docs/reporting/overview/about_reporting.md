# About DoorDash Reporting API

Limited access

Reporting APIs are not yet generally available. Please record interest in early access [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6iSp59hinWQ7ZVb147s0ifZZfRyvDs4uF6d1i8JZyI4Ckaw/viewform)

DoorDash’s reporting API grants integration partners the ability to download Financial, Operations, Menu and Feedback reports. As a result of Merchants generating sales across multiple channels, the need to access data and compile it in a digestible format has become a crucial part of informed decision making and day to day operations. DoorDash aims to provide our Merchants and Authorized Partners with a streamlined way to access the data gathered on Doordash to better operate their business
