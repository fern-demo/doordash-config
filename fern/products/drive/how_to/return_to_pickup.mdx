# Create returnable deliveries

API: Drive

If you’re building for restaurants, see the [How to Build for Restaurants Guide](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants/).

When the receiver of a delivery is unavailable, DoorDash's default action is to have the Dasher safely dispose of the delivery. If you're delivering non-perishable or higher-value goods, you can instead request that the Dasher return the delivery to the pickup location if the receiver is unavailable.

## 1. Create a return-to-pickup delivery[​](#1-create-a-return-to-pickup-delivery "Direct link to heading")

When you create a delivery, you can indicate what should occur if the receiver is unavailable by including the `action_if_unavailable` field in your call to the [delivery creation API](/en-US/api/drive#operation/CreateDelivery) and setting the field's value to `return_to_pickup`.

```
{  
    ... // other fields  
  
    "action_if_undeliverable": "return_to_pickup"  
}  

```

## 2. Receive return-to-pickup webhooks[​](#2-receive-return-to-pickup-webhooks "Direct link to heading")

If you request return-to-pickup deliveries, you should update your app to handle several new webhook events:

* `DELIVERY_RETURN_INITIALIZED`
* `DASHER_CONFIRMED_RETURN_ARRIVAL`
* `DELIVERY_RETURNED`

You should also update your app to handle a new reason that may be sent with the `CANCELLED` webhook:

* `failed_to_return`
