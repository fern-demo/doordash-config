## Get in touch with us [#get-in-touch-with-us]

* All delivery/Dasher-related issues should be handled through DoorDash Merchant Support.

* For those related to a past delivery (e.g. to request a refund for a late delivery), reach out to our email support team at [[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4125332837246c323431312e333501252e2e33252032296f222e2c).

### Best practices [#best-practices]

* State that you're reaching out about a DoorDash Drive delivery
* Be prepared to provide the support\_reference to the agent. This unique integer is returned in our API response upon delivery creation. This may also be referred to as the 'Delivery ID' or 'ID'.

## Technical issues & bugs [#technical-issues--bugs]

To report a bug or ask a question about the Drive API, your developer account, or the integration process, log into the Developer Portal and click 'Support' on the lefthand menu. The first time you reach out to Developer Support, you'll be prompted to provide a bit more detail about your business to help us better assist you. From there, you'll select a Category for your inquiry and provide a description of the issue/question.

### Best practices [#best-practices-1]
