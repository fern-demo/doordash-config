Drive API Production Access is Limited

<Warning>
Production access to the Drive API is currently restricted, and we cannot provide a timeline for certification following development. If you have not completed development and submitted a production access request, we recommend pausing development. Contact us [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfggU_NjGWCdi9vyWUicrnzJmtu9vC4zgbfSC3ROwSvW4eV2g/viewform) to record your interest.
</Warning>

Our mission is simple: we want to be the easiest, most reliable local delivery service available, while protecting the merchants, customers, and Dashers making it happen. We achieve this through a self-serve Portal that allows developers to leverage DoorDash’s extensive network of Dashers in their own business, where every integration is reviewed by our team to ensure that our technological and legal standards are met.

## Before you request production access[​](#before-you-request-production-access "Direct link to heading")

In order to access our production environment and start doing live deliveries, the DoorDash team will review and approve your finished product. To ensure that this process goes smoothly, review the below checklist and these [validation test scripts](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants/#a-validation-checklist-prior-to-requesting-a-demo) before requesting production access. Note that approval is not guaranteed if you check all of the below items, but it’s a great start.

Ensure that:

* You have sufficient guardrails in place to prevent pickup or delivery of restricted items. These include tobacco, cannabis or other illicit drugs, weapons and explosives. See the full list of Restricted Items below for more detail on items that DoorDash cannot deliver.
* You’ve read and agreed to our Technology License and Terms of Use.
* You’ve used the Delivery Simulator to create test deliveries and familiarize yourself with how DoorDash operates.
* Required fields are being passed in all API calls. All required fields are noted in our [guide here for restaurants](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants#d-important-fields) and below. **Please refer to this list rather than the Drive API Reference for guidance on required fields for production access—required fields described in the Drive API reference is not comprehensive.**
* Key delivery details such as the DoorDash-supplied delivery/support ID and pickup time are surfaced to both the merchants and customers your UI. You can read more about our minimum UI requirements [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants#f-delivery-management--tracking).
* There is a clear feedback loop to the end user if DoorDash [rejects the quote and/or delivery request](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants#e-error-handling). For example, if DoorDash returns an error in the API due to an invalid dropoff address, the end user should be prompted to correct their address before completing checkout.
* There is a clear workflow if a merchant or customer [cancels an order](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/build_for_restaurants#g-canceling-a-delivery).
* You’re ready to conduct a live demo with the DoorDash team. You’ll screenshare and take us through an end-to-end test delivery, demonstrating the full user experience.

## Technical/UI[​](#technicalui "Direct link to heading")

Our goal is to offer a delivery service that is seamless, simple, and reliable for all parties involved. Designing and building a great product is up to you, but the technical/UI guidelines below are meant to ensure that your customers have the best possible pickup and delivery experience. See our [How To Get Production Access](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/get_production_access) page for more detail on the demo process and how the DoorDash team will evaluate your submission for production access.
