## What is the DoorDash Developer Portal?[​](#what-is-the-doordash-developer-portal "Direct link to heading")

The Developer Portal is a tool designed to empower developers to explore and build to DoorDash’s Drive fulfillment API seamlessly. In just a few seconds, you can create a developer account and start testing in our sandbox environment. Once you’ve completed development and a demo + review with the DoorDash team, you’ll be able to generate production credentials within the Portal and start requesting drivers to fulfill deliveries for your business.

## What is DoorDash Drive?[​](#what-is-doordash-drive "Direct link to heading")

Drive is DoorDash’s white label fulfillment service, allowing merchants to access a professional delivery fleet, without dealing with the logistics. With DoorDash Drive, you can request a driver any time, track your orders, streamline your delivery costs, and drive incremental sales. Whether you need flexible fulfillment for overflow or a consistent, on-demand delivery service, the Drive platform is designed to work with your business.

## What are the differences between DoorDash Drive and DoorDash Marketplace?[​](#what-are-the-differences-between-doordash-drive-and-doordash-marketplace "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash Marketplace (i.e. the DoorDash App) allows customers to find a business and place orders. DoorDash Drive allows you to offer delivery on your own platform, such as your own app or website. The order details are communicated to DoorDash Drive via API, and a Dasher will handle pickup and delivery for you.

## What countries does DoorDash Drive operate in?[​](#what-countries-does-doordash-drive-operate-in "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash Drive operates in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Additional configuration is required to set up sandbox testing for Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. If you need to test deliveries outside of the US, please reach out via the Support page so the DoorDash team can update your account.

## Who can create a developer account?[​](#who-can-create-a-developer-account "Direct link to heading")

Anyone with an email address can sign up as a DoorDash Developer! Our Developer Portal is designed to streamline the integration process for anyone looking to leverage DoorDash fulfillment in their business, from single retail brands to enterprise-level merchant services platforms.

## Does every member of my development team need to create their own account?[​](#does-every-member-of-my-development-team-need-to-create-their-own-account "Direct link to heading")

No, only 1 Developer Portal account per company is necessary. The Developer Portal supports multi-user login so each member of your team can sign into the same Developer account with their own email and password.

## What do I need to get started?[​](#what-do-i-need-to-get-started "Direct link to heading")

Only your name, phone number, and email address are required to sign up and test in our sandbox environment.

## How do I know if I'm building to Drive vs. Drive Classic? What's the difference?[​](#how-do-i-know-if-im-building-to-drive-vs-drive-classic-whats-the-difference "Direct link to heading")

Drive is our standard API offering and is the default for all developers. Drive Classic is our legacy/1.0 API, and has a separate API reference and endpoints. Classic should only be used by legacy partners who integrated with DoorDash Drive before 2023, or those who were allowlisted by DoorDash to build to Classic. If the URL to your Developer portal dashboard includes **'/Classic'**, you have been allowlisted for Classic. Otherwise, you are developing to Drive.

## How long does it take to build an integration to DoorDash?[​](#how-long-does-it-take-to-build-an-integration-to-doordash "Direct link to heading")

The Developer Portal is designed to give developers tools and resources to build an integration based on their own timeline. Depending on your own roadmap and business needs, this could mean 1-2 days of development or multiple sprints. Once you’ve completed development, our team will schedule a demo to review your finished product and provide an update on production access within 5-10 days.

## Are there items that cannot be delivered through DoorDash?[​](#are-there-items-that-cannot-be-delivered-through-doordash "Direct link to heading")
