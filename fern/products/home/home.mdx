# Why DoorDash + Fern

<Callout intent="success" title="üöÄ Accelerate Your Developer Experience">
Transform your API integration process from 75 days to just 1 week with Fern's powerful developer tools.
</Callout>

## The Challenge Today

<Card title="Current Integration Timeline" icon="clock">
Launching new partners today takes **~75 days**, driven by:
- Confusion in documentation
- Manual onboarding processes  
- Extended developer support cycles
</Card>

## The Fern Solution

Fern helps teams like **Intuit, Square, and Auth0** reduce integration time to under a week through three key innovations:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Language-Native SDKs" icon="code" href="https://github.com/square/square-go-sdk">
Handle boilerplate, reduce errors, and guide developers step-by-step with type-safe, idiomatic SDKs.
</Card>

<Card title="AI-Powered Documentation" icon="robot" href="https://buildwithfern.com/learn/ai-search/overview">
Answer questions in real time, reducing dependence on internal teams with intelligent search and chat.
</Card>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why SDKs Matter

SDKs dramatically improve the integration experience by delivering measurable benefits:

<Steps>
### Accelerating Development
Developers install a package in their language of choice and are ready to build within minutes.

### Improving Accuracy  
SDKs eliminate guesswork by providing autocomplete, type-safe models, and built-in error handling.

### Reducing Support Load
Fewer mistakes mean fewer inbound support tickets and less strain on your team.

### Ensuring Long-term Reliability
As your API evolves, Fern regenerates SDKs instantly ‚Äî keeping partners in sync without custom engineering work.
</Steps>

<Callout intent="info" title="Think of SDKs as Pre-Built Bridges">
Instead of sending partners across rough terrain with a map (docs), you're handing them a paved road.

## üéØ Proven for External API Teams

<Card title="Ned O'Leary, CEO @ Tesseral">
We make API-first auth software. Everything we build has an API for it, and our customers use SDKs for those APIs from their frontend and backend. Fern lets us ship instant updates to our docs and SDKs every time we modify openapi.json. We've seen time to integration get down to just 90 minutes.
