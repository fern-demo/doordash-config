Marketplace APIs are not yet generally available. Please record interest in early access [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfggU_NjGWCdi9vyWUicrnzJmtu9vC4zgbfSC3ROwSvW4eV2g/viewform).
</Warning>

In order to gain access to production after the build is complete, we require our integration partners to go through a certification process to guarantee a good customer experience. As part of this certification process, all tests must be successfully completed and verified before production access is granted.

For each required feature, there is a set of validations that will be reviewed by our team once you [request production access](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/production_access).

Unless otherwise established when sandbox access is granted, integration partners will be expected to submit screen recordings of each required feature for async certification by DoorDash.

If you have any questions on requirements and certification, please reach out via the [Developer Portal support form](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/request_support).

## Onboarding Requirements

Based on your primary purpose of your integration, you are required to build the correlating onboarding requirement (SSIO or SOW).

**[1. Self-Serve Integration Onboarding (SSIO) Flow](#ssio-onboarding-requirements)**

If you are a middleware platform integration and serve multiple merchants, you are required to build [SSIO](#ssio-onboarding-requirements).

**[2. Store Onboarding Webhook (SOW) Flow](#sow-onboarding-requirements)**

If you are a single-merchant integration, you are required to build [SOW](#sow-onboarding-requirements).

### Onboarding SLA Requirements

All integrations are expected to build to the proper onboarding standards and maintain the following onboarding SLAs:

1. **14 Day Partner SLA** - When processing onboarding requests, steps on the partner's end to get a merchant set up (e.g initial sign up, store configuration, menu set up) should be completed within 14 days, followed immediately by a webhook to begin the onboarding process on DoorDash.
2. **48 Hour Escalation SLA**​ - When processing onboarding requests, you will be able to utilize DoorDash Developer Portal to view status updates for each store going through the onboarding process. We expect menu issues that are visible for stores in the Developer Portal to be resolved within 48 business hours of the webhook timestamp.

*Please note failure to adhere will make your integration non-compliant and be at risk of having all further integration onboarding requests suspended.*

### SSIO Onboarding Requirements

SSIO is required for all middleware platform integrations. The full specifications for SSIO can be found [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/overview/onboarding/ssio/), but all required features are listed below.

* It is required that you are always ready to accept new fields and field values at any time from DoorDash.
* For example, if we add a new field to the order payload or add a new field to one of our webhooks, you will be able to ingest this with no issues. Also, if we update a value from a 32-bit integer to 64-bit, you will be able to ingest this with no issues.

## Enablement Requirements

### Order Failure Reason Documentation

In order to provide the best in class merchant experience, we need to equip our technical teams with the clear and detailed error messages along with proper troubleshooting steps.

**It is required to set up your integration failure reasons based on the required failure reasons listed [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/order_integration#order-failures---required-failure-reasons).**

*This will be expected to be submitted during certification as a google sheet.*

This includes:

* The exact failure message string that will be returned to DoorDash when a failure occurs
* A detailed breakdown of what the failure message means
* The DRI who is responsible to solve the issue which helps our team where to direct the issue i.e is this something a Merchant can solve on their own by adjusting configurations or is this something we need to escalate to your technical team to address
* A detailed breakdown of the steps. If this is an issue the Merchant needs to fix, please link out to any relevant help articles.

If this is an issue your technical team needs to fix, please be sure to include any data that would be helpful to your team during troubleshooting i.e timestamps, store integration ids, etc.

### Merchant Facing Materials

If you are a third-party integration partner, you will also be required to share merchant facing enablement materials during certification in order to be granted production access.
*These will be expected to be submitted during certification.*

This includes:

* A link to your Merchant facing portal i.e where a Merchant can log in to begin the onboarding process and/or manage their integration.
* A URL for a help article where Merchants can find information on menu and store availability management to educate Merchants on how to manage their menus, 86 items, and configure store hours.
* A URL for a help article where merchants can find any other key additional information on managing their stores once integrated i.e how to pause their store, manage orders, etc.

## Quality Requirements

To ensure a quality experience for our mutual merchants, we require partners to adhere to specific quality and performance standards. This criteria includes:

* < 1% error rate on the integration
* At least 1 menu update per store per day

Integration health can be monitored directly in the Developer Portal and technical support is also available directly through the [Developer Portal Support form](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/request_support).

**Note:** These quality standards are subject to change. Once updated, your team will have 6 months to make the required changes to meet the updated quality standards to continue onboarding additional stores in production.

*Please note failure to adhere may result in temporary or permanently revoked API access.*
