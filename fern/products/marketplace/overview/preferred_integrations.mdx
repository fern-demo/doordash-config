## Introducing DoorDash Preferred Integrations Program (DPIP)[â€‹](#introducing-doordash-preferred-integrations-program-dpip "Direct link to heading")

Through extensive market research, NPS data from merchants, and feedback from the front lines, weâ€™ve identified what it takes to deliver a high-quality integration experience.

The **DoorDash Preferred Integrations Program (DPIP)**, formerly known as the Integrations Quality Initiative, ensures merchants have a top-tier integration experience through:

* Collaborating with our integration partners to ensure they meet functionality and performance standards that have the highest impact on the restaurant operating experience
* Continuously externalizing the results of this collaboration through a merchant-facing webpage that tracks integration health in real time, enabling merchants to select the right partner for their business or see where their current provider stands.

ðŸš€ Please find our webpage showcasing preferred integration partners here: **[Preferred Integration Partner webpage](https://merchants.doordash.com/en-us/preferred-integrations)**

This page highlights performance and feature offerings to help Merchants choose the right Partner or evaluate their current integration.

*Read on below to ensure your integration is displayed as Preferred.*

## How It Works[â€‹](#how-it-works "Direct link to heading")

Our webpage will display all integration partners who meet the **Minimum Quality Integration (MQI)** standards:

* **Order failure rate** below 1%
* **Merchant cancel rate** below 1%

If a partner fails to meet and maintain these standards by **8/1/25**, they will be removed from the DPIP webpage and onboarding will be suspended on the DoorDash platform. Review your quality status in the Developer Portal.

## FAQs[â€‹](#faqs "Direct link to heading")

### What does my quality status mean?[â€‹](#what-does-my-quality-status-mean "Direct link to heading")

* **DoorDash Certified**: Based on rolling data from the last 28 days DoorDash Certified providers meet required performance standards
* **DoorDash Preferred Integration**: Based on rolling data from the last 28 days, DoorDash Preferred Integrations meet required performance standards and support all high-quality features.
* **At Risk of Suspension**: Based on rolling data from the last 28 days, At Risk means that your order failure rate and/or merchant cancel rate are above 1%. As such, you are at risk of being removed from the DPIP webpage and suspended from onboarding new merchants to your integration with DoorDash.

### Why am I at risk of suspension?[â€‹](#why-am-i-at-risk-of-suspension "Direct link to heading")

Based on rolling data from the last 28 days, your integration doesn't currently meet the minimum performance standards:

* Order failure rate below 1%
* Merchant cancel rate below 1%

### What happens if I'm at risk of suspension?[â€‹](#what-happens-if-im-at-risk-of-suspension "Direct link to heading")

You will have until 8/1/25 to meet minimum performance standards before you are removed from the DPIP webpage and suspended from onboarding new merchants to your integration with DoorDash.

After 8/1/25: If you are compliant as of 8/1/25, but your order failure rate and/or merchant cancel rate exceed 1%, your integration will be at risk of suspension. You will have 6 weeks to meet minimum performance standards before you are removed from the DPIP webpage and suspended from onboarding new merchants to your integration with DoorDash.

### What happens if I'm suspended?[â€‹](#what-happens-if-im-suspended "Direct link to heading")

If you are suspended, your integration will be removed from the DPIP webpage, and you will be unable to onboard new merchants to your integration with DoorDash.

Merchants currently using your integration with DoorDash will not be affected by the suspension and can continue to onboard new stores within the same business to your integration.

### Can suspension be reversed?[â€‹](#can-suspension-be-reversed "Direct link to heading")

Yes! To reverse a suspension, you must meet minimum performance requirements based on 28-day rolling data. Once you do so, your suspension will be automatically reversed, your integration will appear on the DPIP webpage, and you will be able to onboard new merchants to your integration with DoorDash.

### When do suspensions begin?[â€‹](#when-do-suspensions-begin "Direct link to heading")

* **Starting August 1, 2025**

Suspensions will start on 8/1/2025, meaning that integrations that don't meet minimum performance requirements will be removed from the DPIP webpage and suspended from onboarding new merchants to their DoorDash integration on 8/1/2025.

After 8/1/2025, you will have 6 weeks from the day your integration is deemed at risk of suspension to improve your minimum performance standards before your integration is suspended.

### How do I earn a DoorDash Preferred Integration rating?[â€‹](#how-do-i-earn-a-doordash-preferred-integration-rating "Direct link to heading")

To earn the DoorDash Preferred Integration rating, you must meet the following criteria:

1. **Meet and maintain the following performance standards:**

   * Order failure rate below 1%
   * Merchant cancel rate below 1%
2. **Support at least 250 DoorDash stores**
3. **Support all of the following features:**

   * [Self-serve integration onboarding (SSIO)\*](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/overview/onboarding/ssio/)
   * [Activation within SSIO\*](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/overview/onboarding/ssio/#store-activation-within-ssio)
   * [Menu pull](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/menu_pull/)
   * [86 items](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/item_status)
   * [Order Ready Signal](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/order_ready_signal/)

### Can my quality status change over time?[â€‹](#can-my-quality-status-change-over-time "Direct link to heading")

Yes, your quality status is based on rolling 28-day data, meaning that your quality status can change daily. You will need to meet and maintain program standards to keep or improve your quality status.

### How did you pick these performance standards and features?[â€‹](#how-did-you-pick-these-performance-standards-and-features "Direct link to heading")

Based on extensive market research, daily NPS data collected from merchants, and feedback from the front lines, we found that these performance standards and integration features have the greatest impact on the factors that merchants care about most: onboarding and live order management.

### What order are providers listed in on the DPIP webpage?[â€‹](#what-order-are-providers-listed-in-on-the-dpip-webpage "Direct link to heading")

Providers are stack ranked on the webpage first by high-quality feature depth and then by performance rating (calculated from cumulative order failure rate and merchant cancel rate).

### How did you calculate my integration maturity?[â€‹](#how-did-you-calculate-my-integration-maturity "Direct link to heading")

Your integration maturity is based on how many DoorDash stores you support with your integration:

* Less than 250 stores - Emerging
* 250 or more stores - Established

Supporting more stores on DoorDash reduces the volatility of your minimum performance standards.

### What does it mean to "support" a high-quality feature?[â€‹](#what-does-it-mean-to-support-a-high-quality-feature "Direct link to heading")

Within the context of this program, "supporting" a high-quality feature means that you've built and launched the feature and that it has been used by at least one DoorDash store.

### What does my performance rating on the DPIP page mean?[â€‹](#what-does-my-performance-rating-on-the-dpip-page-mean "Direct link to heading")

Your performance rating is calculated from your cumulative order failure rate and merchant cancel rate.

The tiers are as follows:

* Excellent - < 0.5%
* Very Good - 0.5â€“1%
* Good - 1â€“2.0%
* Not shown - > 2%

### Will DoorDash Preferred Integration requirements change?[â€‹](#will-doordash-preferred-integration-requirements-change "Direct link to heading")

Yes, we will add new requirements up to two times per year to ensure we are continuously upleveling the merchant experience.

You will need to meet and maintain new requirements to keep or improve your quality status. We will give ample time to build new high-quality features before they are publicly communicated to merchants as DoorDash Preferred Integration requirements.

### How do merchants refer to minimum performance standards and high-quality features?[â€‹](#how-do-merchants-refer-to-minimum-performance-standards-and-high-quality-features "Direct link to heading")

To make the DPIP more merchant-friendly, we refer to some of the program requirements differently when speaking with merchants:

| Provider-facing term | Merchant-facing term |
| --- | --- |
| Order failure rate | POS proactive cancel rate |
| Merchant cancel rate | Merchant avoidable cancellation rate |
| Self-serve integration onboarding (SSIO) | Self-guided store setup |
| Activation within SSIO | Self-serve store activation |
| Menu pull | Real-time menu syncing |
| 86 items | Real-time menu 86ing |
| Order ready signal | Order ready signal |

### Why is my integration not displayed on the webpage?[â€‹](#why-is-my-integration-not-displayed-on-the-webpage "Direct link to heading")

If your integration is newly launched on the platform (i.e., a new build recently released to production), it will not appear on the webpage until **28 days of production data** have been collected. This is because key metricsâ€”such as cancellation and error ratesâ€”are calculated based on the **last 28 days (L28D)** of data. Until this data is available, these metrics will not be visible in the portal or displayed on the public webpage.

Additionally, some features in the Merchant Portal rely on **feature flags** that are only activated once the integration is actively used in production. If the integration hasn't been used yet, these features (and related visibility) may not be available.

In short: Once your integration has been live in production and actively used for 28 days, it should appear on the webpage along with its associated metrics.
