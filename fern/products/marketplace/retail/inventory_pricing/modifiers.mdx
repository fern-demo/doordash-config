## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* An existing test store with a catalog.
* Capability to perform inventory updates through the [pull job management](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/how_to/store_item_pull_job) process.
* Notification to your DoorDash technical account manager regarding your intention to implement modifiers and confirmation of proper store configuration.

## Overview [#overview]

Modifiers, facilitated through the Pull Job Management API, enable items on the Retail UI to incorporate modifiers. This functionality is particularly essential for partners managing stores offering hot and prepared items.

## Getting Started [#getting-started]

Follow these steps to configure and employ modifiers effectively:

### Step 1: Configure Items with Modifiers [#step-1-configure-items-with-modifiers]

Ensure that items are appropriately configured with modifiers as per provided [specifications.](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/8e7b425df2/#tag/InventoryManagementEndpoints/operation/batchAddStoreItem)

### Step 2: Trigger a Pull Job [#step-2-trigger-a-pull-job]

Initiate a [pull job](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/how_to/store_item_pull_job) to update DoorDash's inventory, encompassing the modifier items.

### Step 3: Configure Usage of V1 Endpoints [#step-3-configure-usage-of-v1-endpoints]

Configure the utilization of item and item option activation [endpoints](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/store_and_item_status#batch-item-activation-status-change).

## Progress Check [#progress-check]

To verify your progress:

* Confirm the successful processing of the pull job through Developer Portal event logs.
* Navigate to your test store to confirm the accurate display of modifiers for the intended items.
* Place a test order to validate modifier functionality.
* Attempt deactivation/reactivation of items and options using [PUT Item and Item Option endpoints](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/store_and_item_status#batch-item-activation-status-change) to ensure proper functionality.

## Frequently Asked Questions [#frequently-asked-questions]

### How can I update attributes for items with modifiers? [#how-can-i-update-attributes-for-items-with-modifiers]

The Pull Job endpoint [Pull Job endpoint](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/how_to/store_item_pull_job) is the only way to add, delete, or update attributes for items with modifiers, including parent items as well as extras/options.

### Can I directly activate or suspend modifiers or the parent item? [#can-i-directly-activate-or-suspend-modifiers-or-the-parent-item]

Yes, the OpenAPI endpoint [PUT Item and Item Option](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/store_and_item_status#batch-item-activation-status-change) activation/suspension can be used for items and modifiers (extras/options) if partners require direct activation or suspension.

### What will happen if I send a POST/PATCH request to the Inventory/Pricing endpoint for an item with modifiers? [#what-will-happen-if-i-send-a-postpatch-request-to-the-inventorypricing-endpoint-for-an-item-with-modifiers]

If a request contains an item with modifiers, the entire request will fail. None of the items included in the request will be updated.
