### FAQ[​](#faq "Direct link to heading")

1. **What timezone should my ‘start\_time’ and ‘end\_time’ be?**

   * The hours should be set based on the timezone of the store.
2. **How can I send hours if my store is open overnight?**

   * For specific information on how to configure the store hour fields, please refer to our Hours Configuration Reference.
3. **How can I send hours if my store is open 24/7?**

   * For specific information on how to configure the store hour fields, please refer to our Hours Configuration Reference.
4. **What causes a store hours update request to fail?**

   * DoorDash will fail the job if store hours fall into any of the following categories:
     + Overlapping Hours across multiple days.
     + Start Time = End Time and times are not 00:00.
     + Store Open Hours are less than 30 minutes.
5. **How can I send hours if my store is closed?**

   * If a store is closed on a particular day (like a holiday), use Store Special Hours and set `closed = true`.
   * If a store is always closed on a particular day of the week, use Store Open Hours and set `start_time = 00:00` and `end_time = 00:00` for that `day_index` or omit the `day_index` entirely.
   * If a store is temporarily closed on all days, DoorDash Store Availability webhooks should be used to deactivate the store. Additional information on our Store Availability Webhooks can be found [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/store_and_item_status#store-activation-status-change).
6. **Why is my store on DoorDash closing earlier than the hours sent?**

   * This is a platform-wide logic where a buffer is applied to all stores on the DoorDash site. This allows for food prep time, time for Dasher arrival, etc., before the store actually closes.
7. **Can I set hours for a specific item?**

   * Yes, there is the capability to control hourly availability at an Item Level, rather than a store level. This information will be sent via our Inventory/Pricing API. Store Hours will remain the default availability if Item Hours are not defined. More details can be found [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace_v2/#tag/InventoryManagementEndpoints/operation/batchAddStoreItem).
