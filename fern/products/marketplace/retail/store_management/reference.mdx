## Store Open Hours[​](#store-open-hours "Direct link to heading")

* `open_hours.start_time`: Local start time for when orders can successfully be placed.
* `open_hours.end_time`: Local end time for when orders can successfully be placed.
* `open_hours.day_index`: Day of the week for specified hours.

### Considerations when setting hours:[​](#considerations-when-setting-hours "Direct link to heading")

* DoorDash deducts 20 minutes from `open_hours.end_time` to determine the true ordering hours for our Marketplace. This allows Dashers ample time to pick up the order before the restaurant closes.
* To display hours as ‘All Day’ on Marketplace, set hours to the following:

  ```
  "start_time": "00:00:00",  
  "end_time": "23:59:59"  

  ```
* If `open_hours.end_time` is less than `open_hours.start_time`, this is interpreted as hours that extend into the next day. As an example, the below would translate to the store being open from 8:00 am to 1:40 am:

  ```
  "start_time": "08:00:00",  
  "end_time": "02:00:00"  

  ```
* Hours for a single menu cannot have separate specified hour periods that overlap. As an example, these hours below would be considered invalid:

  ```
  {  
      "day_index": "FRI",  
      "start_time": "08:00:00",  
      "end_time": "02:00:00"  
  },  
  {  
      "day_index": "SAT",  
      "start_time": "01:00:00",  
      "end_time": "22:00:00"  
  }  

  ```

## Store Special Hours[​](#store-special-hours "Direct link to heading")

Store Special Hours can be used to specify operating hours for a distinct date that differ from your typical hours. You may use special hours to either close, shorten, or extend operating hours.

* `special_hours.start_time`: Local start time for when orders can successfully be placed.
* `special_hours.end_time`: Local end time for when orders can successfully be placed.
* `special_hours.date`: Discrete date of when special hours will be enforced.
* `special_hours.closed`: Boolean indicating whether the store is closed or not on this date.

Because Store Special Hours are date-specific, if you wish to specify interday special hours, separate dates must be used:

```
"special_hours": [  
   {  
       "date": "2022-11-24",  
       "closed": false,  
       "start_time": "12:00:00",  
       "end_time": "23:59:59"  
   },  
   {  
       "date": "2022-11-25",  
       "closed": false,  
       "start_time": "00:00:00",  
       "end_time": "00:30:00"  
   }  
]  

```
