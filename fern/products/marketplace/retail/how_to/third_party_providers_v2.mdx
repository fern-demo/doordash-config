1. **Join the Developer Portal:**

   * Create a [Developer Portal](https://developer.doordash.com/portal?Marketplace=true) account to establish a Developer Portal organization.
     + **Note:** If you already have a DoorDash account with their associated email, you can just “Sign-In” using the existing account OR you can use a different email address to create a new account.
   * Follow [these steps](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/add_members) to add additional members to the development team.
2. **Add a Marketplace Integration:**

   * Reach out to your DoorDash technical account manager to add a Marketplace integration.
3. **Create a Provider:**

   * Configure a sandbox provider using the guide [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/create_a_provider).
4. **Create Credentials:**

   * Create sandbox credentials following these [instructions](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/how_to/manage_credentials/).
5. **Configure JWT Authentication:**

   * Follow the DoorDash guide to configure the JWT authentication method required for API interaction. [Guide to Configure JWT Authentication](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/JWTs)
6. **Test Store Setup:**

   * Reach out to your DoorDash technical account manager to have a test store added to the Developer Portal.

## Steps to Build API Integration [#steps-to-build-api-integration]

#### Mandatory Orders Integration Features [#mandatory-orders-integration-features]

The following features are mandatory for all Third-Party Provider orders integrations serving Retail merchants.

* Auto-confirm orders - [instructions](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/orders/overview#asynchronous-order-confirmation)
* Order adjustments
  + Implement merchant order adjustment - [instructions](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/orders/features/order_adjustment)
  + Implement merchant order cancellation - [instructions](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/orders/features/order_cancel)
  + *IMPORTANT* See below for important details on completing the order adjustment flow by consuming updated order payloads
* Receive updated order payloads
  + Following a successful order adjustment, DoorDash will fire a webhook with an updated order payload reflected the adjustment
  + Subscribe to the "Order Adjustment" event type in the Developer Portal
  + Parse updated order payload and surface to merchants in partner portal: the new "event" object descirbes what type of adjustment was performed and when; the "order" object is exactly the same as a typical [order](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/orders/reference/order), it simply reflects the adjusted order.
  + *IMPORTANT* Treat receipt of the updated order payload as confirmation of successful order adjustment. After the merchant submits their order adjustment, show them a modal with a spinning icon, if the updated order payload arrives (typically within 10 seconds), show the merchant confirmation of a successful order adjustment, and update the order cart the merchant sees to show the results of the update (e.g. strike through the original item name and show the substituted item name). If, on the other hand, the updated order payload does not arrive, show the merchant that the order adjustment failed and give them the option to try again or cancel the whole order.
* "Ready for Pickup" signal - [instructions](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/retail/orders/features/order_ready)
  + Improves order delivery speed
