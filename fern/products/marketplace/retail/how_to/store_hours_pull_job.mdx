## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to heading")

As part of the integration workflow, partners can implement an endpoint that allows DoorDash to pull the opening hours for a store location. This refreshes the store hours for a store, changing when Customers are able to order items from the store.

The response from this endpoint should match the [Store model](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace_v2/#tag/ItemManagementModels/Store).

## Get Started[​](#get-started "Direct link to heading")

---

### Step 1: Set up Endpoint Specification to Pull Store Hours[​](#step-1-set-up-endpoint-specification-to-pull-store-hours "Direct link to heading")

The set up of the endpoint is:

**GET**
`/{merchant_pull_endpoint}/{store_location_id}`

`store_location_id` is the unique Merchant Supplied ID that is configured for that store location. The endpoint will deliver the store hours for 1 single location at a time. This endpoint should be different from the Inventory pull endpoint.

### Step 2: Ensure that store.json response from endpoint has the correct format[​](#step-2-ensure-that-storejson-response-from-endpoint-has-the-correct-format "Direct link to heading")

As mentioned above, the Store Hours pull request must return the response that matches [Store request model](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace_v2#tag/ItemManagementModels/Store)

*Note: The response should contain all regular and special hours for a store. DoorDash will replace the current hours of the store with the ones from the json response when calling the pull job endpoint.*

Model response expected from endpoint:

```
{  
  "merchant_supplied_store_id": "string",  
  "open_hours": [  
    {  
      "day_index": "MON",  
      "start_time": "string",  
      "end_time": "string"  
    }  
  ],  
  "special_hours": [  
    {  
      "date": "string",  
      "start_time": "string",  
      "end_time": "string",  
      "closed": true  
    }  
  ]  
}  
  

```

### Step 3: Enroll your endpoint in the Developer Portal[​](#step-3-enroll-your-endpoint-in-the-developer-portal "Direct link to heading")

Once the endpoint is ready, enroll it using the Developer Portal:

1. Navigate to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.doordash.com/portal)
2. Navigate to your Marketplace integration
3. Navigate to the "Webhook subscriptions" section
4. Click "Configure endpoint"
5. Select the appropriate provider type
6. For "Event", select "Store Hours Pull"
7. Enter the URL

   * Enter the base URL only: `https://{merchant_pull_endpoint}`. DoorDash will send through the store*location\_id \_at the end of the URL* each time a request is made. Your endpoint must accept that URL parameter and return the store hours data only for the store specified.
8. Enter the authentication token (if needed)

   * Currently we support static tokens and Oauth authentication mechanisms when calling Pull endpoints.
