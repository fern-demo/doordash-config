## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

This feature is built for merchants utilizing our self-delivery offering. You must have successfully built out the ability to ingest the self-delivery orders as outlined [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/self_delivery)

## Overview [#overview]

DoorDash has enhanced our self-delivery offering to allow merchants with an in-house fleet to provide status updates once an order is out for delivery. This includes both status updates and location tracking.

## Get Started [#get-started]

### Step 1: Identify endpoint [#step-1-identify-endpoint]

Identify the [order events endpoint](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace/#tag/Order-Endpoints/operation/storeConfirmOrderReadyForPickup)

**PATCH**
[https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/orders/{"{id}"}/events/{"{event_type}"}](https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/orders/%7Bid%7D/events/%7Bevent_type%7D)

### Step 2: Understand the event types [#step-2-understand-the-event-types]

Self-delivery order event updates can have the following event types: `ORDER_READY_FOR_PICKUP`, `ORDER_PICKED_UP`, `ORDER_IS_ARRIVING`, and `ORDER_DELIVERED`

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ORDER\_READY\_FOR\_PICKUP | Sent when in-store operators are finished preparing the order and is ready for pickup by the in-house courier. |
| ORDER\_PICKED\_UP | Sent when the courier has picked up the order and left the store. |
| ORDER\_IS\_ARRIVING | Sent when the courier is approxiamtely 400 meters from the desired delivery location. |
| ORDER\_DELIVERED | Sent when the order has been dropped off |

### Step 3: Understand the possible webhook fields [#step-3-understand-the-possible-webhook-fields]

`merchant_supplied_id`: (required) When a merchant initially confirms a self-delivery order, they pass their internal order id in the `merchant_supplied_id` field. This is the same value that we send back in the payload.

`latitude`: (optional) Used to share the couriers latitude. DoorDash will utilize this value to share courier location updates with customers.

`longitude`: (optional) Used to share the couriers longitude. DoorDash will utilize this value to share courier location updates with customers.

`maskedPhoneNumber`: (optional) Masked phone number value that will be passed to the customer to allow contact from customer to courier.

`firstName`: (required) The couriers first name.

`isBatched`: (optional) Inform DoorDash if the order has been batched. Will allow DoorDash to communicate to customer that a courier is completing a nearby delivery.

### Step 4: Implement [#step-4-implement]

Route order to the endpoint using the specified format.

#### Update with status `ORDER_READY_FOR_PICKUP` or `ORDER_DELIVERED` [#update-with-status-order_ready_for_pickup-or-order_delivered]

```
    {  
      "merchant_supplied__id": "0nb24d02-e25f-4acb-aeb0-e387b1335791"   
    }  

```

#### Update with status `ORDER_PICKED_UP` or `ORDER_IS_ARRIVING` [#update-with-status-order_picked_up-or-order_is_arriving]

```
   {  
      "delivery_details": {  
        "latitude": 40.73528589964759,  
        "longitude": -73.99417110394303,  
        "is_batched": false,  
        "courier_details": {  
          "masked_phone_number": "+18888888888",  
          "first_name": "Driver Name"  
    }  
  }  
}  
  

```

## FAQ [#faq]

1. **How often can I send courier location updates?**

   * DoorDash can accept location updates every 30 seconds.
2. **What event type should be used to send courier location updates?**

   * You can continue to use the `ORDER_PICKED_UP` to update courier locations after the order has been picked up until the courier is close enough to the customer to send the `ORDER_IS_ARRIVING` event type.
