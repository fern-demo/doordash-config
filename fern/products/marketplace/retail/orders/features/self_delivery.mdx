# Enable Self Delivery

# Enable self-delivery

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Some merchants with an in-house fleet prefer using their own drivers. We launched
self-delivery to allow merchants to benefit from our marketing service by featuring their
restaurant on our platform.

## Overview [#overview]

DoorDash rolled-out a new product called ‘Self-Delivery’ that allows restaurants to be featured
on doordash.com, but fulfill orders with their own delivery fleet. Additional information is passed
through to the merchant to guarantee a smooth Self-Delivery experience.

## Get Started [#get-started]

### How [#how]

Self-Delivery is configured at the store level in DoorDash. When a store is configured for
Self-Delivery, DoorDash will send additional fields on the order payload (sample). This
information will give the merchant the details that are required to deliver an order. These
fields include:

* `address_instructions` : Any delivery level instructions entered by the customer (example: Gate Code to enter apartment building is 1234)
* `delivery_address` : Customer’s delivery address information
* `delivery_fee` : Delivery fee that was charged to the customer

Additionally, some POS systems and merchants require that these orders are sent with a type
of ‘delivery’ rather than the usual ‘pickup’ order type. If required by the merchant, aggregators
will need to send this delivery type to the POS system.

## FAQ [#faq]

1. **How is a store’s delivery radius determined?**

In addition to marking the store as Self-Delivery, merchants set their own delivery radius for the store. Merchants can set a simple circular radius around the store, or if they provide a map, a custom delivery zone. In order to set up a custom delivery zone DoorDash will need a KML file showing the borders they want.

2. **Can merchants toggle between in-house and Doordash fulfillment?**

In the current state, a store must be able to complete 100% of deliveries. There is
no toggling between in-house and DoorDash fulfillment. However, we are looking to
introduce a ruled based ‘toggle functionality’ in early 2021.

3. **If the store receives an order that it cannot deliver, what should be done?**

The store can either manually request a DoorDash Driver for fulfillment through our web
based Drive Form or cancel the order (discouraged).

4. **If the store’s delivery radius is set eg. 1 mile around the store, will orders outside
   of 1 mile be delivered by DoorDash?**

No .Currently there is no ‘toggle functionality’ that allows merchants to automatically
fulfill orders by DoorDash. However, we are planning to build a rule based logic in early
FY21 that allows merchants to automatically assign orders outside x miles to DoorDash
drivers.

5. **What is ‘rule based logic’?**

Rule based logic will allow merchants to automatically assign orders to in-house or
DoorDash drivers based on predefined rules. The first rules we are going to build are
time and distance based. Eg. a merchant can set up their store to use in-house drivers
from 10am to 6pm and DoorDash drivers from 6pm to 10pm. Similarly, the merchant can
automatically assign orders outside of eg. 5 miles to DoorDash drivers but use in-house
Drivers for orders within 5 miles.
