# Merchant Order Adjustments

# Implement Merchant order adjustment

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

DoorDash has developed new functionality for OpenAPI merchants to adjust orders that have
already been accepted.

DoorDash has enhanced the Open API contract by creating a new endpoint and enhancing the
order API contract that will allow for adjustments at the line level. Integration partners must be able to send requests to this endpoint once added to the allow-list by their Technical Account
Manager (TAM).

The endpoint URL requires the DoorDash order UUID that is being adjusted and the body of the
request should include a JSON that details its reasoning.

## Overview [#overview]

POS-integrated merchants are typically set up to accept and confirm orders as long as the order
passes through a set of validations. Occasionally, there are orders that are automatically
confirmed by the merchant, but then need to be subsequently adjusted due to a variety of
reasons (lack of capacity, item unavailability, etc).

In this scenario, merchants must call DoorDash support to have the order canceled entirely and
can’t fulfill the remainder of the Customer’s order. This can be time-consuming for both sides and gets amplified during peak hours.

This feature aims to increase flexibility with orders and cut down on order cancellations.

## Get Started [#get-started]

---

### Step 1 [#step-1]

Reach out to your technical account manager to ensure you are added to the allowlist for Merchant Induced Order adjustments

### Step 2 [#step-2]

Route adjustment request to new endpoint using the specified format and receive a response back from DoorDash

#### Response and Error Codes [#response-and-error-codes]

Once a request is received, DoorDash will respond with one of the following status codes

| Response | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| 202 | Return a 202 status to indicate that the data was received successfully |
| 404 | Order not found |
| 400 | Bad request, order not confirmed, order already cancelled, syntax |
| 500 | Other, if line\_item\_id or line\_option\_id doesn't match with what’s in the order JSON |

## Substitution adjustment [#substitution-adjustment]

DoorDash also has the functionality that will allow merchants integrated via order API to
share substitutions for order post checkout.

If the original item is unavailable during the picking process, merchants can select the next best
available option. We will need to receive the following information via the adjustment endpoint to
update the customer and final receipt.

| Request Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| item\_substitute | Newly introduced adjustment\_type, which will replace the original line item / line option |
| name | Substitute items name |
| merchant\_supplied\_id | Merchant’s internal item ID for substitute item |
| price | Price of substitute item |
| quantity | New quantity of substituted item |

## FAQs [#faqs]

**How will reimbursement work for orders canceled via this feature?**

Following our [reimbursement](https://help.doordash.com/merchants/s/article/Do-I-get-paid-for-cancelled-orders?language=en_US) policy, Merchants are not reimbursed for cancellations
initiated/induced by them.

**Is there any sort of punishment for canceling orders?**

There is not a punishment for canceling orders, however if a high number of
cancellations is detected, the store may be deactivated temporarily to preserve the
customer experience.

**Can I adjust orders using my system’s unique identifier that is sent back on order
confirmation?**

No, we can only accept order adjustments referencing the DoorDash order UUID.

**Can I adjust orders/modifiers using my system’s unique identifier (Merchant Supplied ID) of
the product that is sent in the menu?**

No. We need our integration partners to maintain the new unique ID of the item and
option line items so we can process the cancellation or adjustment for the correct
product.

**How will customers be notified that their order is being adjusted?**

Customers will be notified of their adjustments via email.

**Can I adjust the quantity of the only item in a cart to 0?**

While you will receive an “OK” when carrying out this function, the cart will not be
adjusted. Please use the order cancellation endpoint instead.
