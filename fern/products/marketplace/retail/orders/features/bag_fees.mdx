# Receive Bag Fees

# Receive bag fees

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

DoorDash has functionality within our Open API Order to allow Merchants to
collect a bag fee and any necessary taxes related to the fee to meet any specific government
regulations.

## Overview [#overview]

Certain regional legislatures require Merchants to charge customers a bag fee during
checkout. Enabling this feature will allow Merchants to comply with the requirements
set by their stores' jurisdictions.

## Get Started [#get-started]

### Step 1: Enable Bag Fee at Checkout [#step-1-enable-bag-fee-at-checkout]

The Merchant will provide a list of stores and the associated bag fee to [DoorDash Merchant Support](https://help.doordash.com/merchants/s/?language=en_US) to have the bag fee manually configured.

### Step 2: Implement - Order Payload [#step-2-implement---order-payload]

The Order payload will contain the custom\_fee field populated by an array with a
single object.

* `custom_fee.type`: "BAG\_FEE"
* `custom_fee.price`: non-decimal currency based on the value manually configured (e.g. 30 = $0.30)
* `custom_fee.tax`: non-decimal currency based on the store's individual tax requirements based on location

```json
{  
"custom_fee": [  
  
        {  
          "type": "BAG_FEE",  
          "price": 30,  
          "tax": 5,  
        }  
    ]     
}  

```

## Progress Check [#progress-check]

A test order can be placed at a store with bag fee enabled. Within the order, the custom\_fee array will be populated.
