# User roles

If you're working with a team to build or manage your integration with DoorDash, you can [add your team members](/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/add_members) to your organization so they can perform key tasks like managing credentials, setting up webhooks, submitting support requests and more. When you add a member to an organization, you must select a **role** that defines what that person can do when they use the Developer Portal.
