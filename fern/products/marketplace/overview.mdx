DoorDash Marketplace API enables partners to manage their menu, store, and order data. Through our Menu API, you will be able to create and update the menus you wish to display to consumers on DoorDash. Through our Order Webhook, you will be able to receive live order data from DoorDash directly to your system. Through our Store webhook, you will be able to control store level data such as store availability and item availability. DoorDash Merchant API is an asynchronous API organized around REST. JSON is returned by all API responses and we use conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. All requests must be made using https or they will fail.
