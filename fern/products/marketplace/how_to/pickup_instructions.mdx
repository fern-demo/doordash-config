## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

To allow Merchants to send pickup instructions, this must be built out on the Provider side and then the value can be passed to DoorDash within order confirmation.

## Overview [#overview]

DoorDash has a field within the order confirmation process to allow for a merchant to send a tailored message with instructions for the Dasher per each distinct order. The field that can be used is `"pickup_instructions"`.



There are 2 moments in the pickup process when the Dasher sees instructions:

* When they first receive the order
* When they arrive at the store

There are 4 types of pickup instructions that can be utilized and shown to the Dasher:

* Default store-level pickup instructions (set in the Merchant Portal)
* Arrival store-level pickup instructions (set in the Merchant Portal)
* Order-level pickup instructions (sent via the API)
* Dynamic store-level instructions (set in the Merchant Portal)

No type of pickup instructions will overwrite or replace another type

* If more than 1 type of pickup instructions are utilized they will all display to the Dasher in the app

## Get Started [#get-started]

---

### Step 1: Identify endpoint [#step-1-identify-endpoint]

Identify the [order confirmation endpoint](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace#tag/Order-Endpoints/operation/confirmOrder)

**PATCH**
[https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/orders/{"{id}"}](https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/orders/%7Bid%7D)

### Step 2: Add pickup\_instructions field [#step-2-add-pickup_instructions-field]

Add the additional field `"pickup_instructions"` within the order confirmation PATCH body.

**Example:**

```json
{  
  
"merchant_supplied_id": "string",  
  
"order_status": "success",  
  
"failure_reason": "string",  
  
"prep_time": "2021-10-13T17:32:59Z"  
  
"pickup_instructions": "string"  
  
}  

```

### Step 3: Implement [#step-3-implement]

Implement a way for Merchants to add pickup instructions through the POS which can be passed to DoorDash which will be shared with the Dasher.

## Progress Check [#progress-check]

A test order can be placed and within the order confirmation you can ensure that the `"pickup_instructions"` are being sent within the body and are sent successfully.

1. [Place and receive a test order.](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/order_integration)
2. [Confirm the test order.](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace#tag/Order-Endpoints/operation/confirmOrder) and ensure the `"pickup_instructions"` are included within the Confirm Order webhook.

## Next Steps [#next-steps]

Present to your Merchants on how they can leverage this functionality. Such as:

1. Merchants are generating short codes to expedite order identification/retrieval by

Dasher in-store

2. Item specific instructions to ensure proper handling during fulfillment (I.e hot

handle with care, retrieve from pickup rack via side door, etc.)
