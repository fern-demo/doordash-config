## Using the Store Status Webhook Function [#using-the-store-status-webhook-function]

### The Challenge [#the-challenge]

From losing connectivity to receiving too many orders at once, there's no shortage of challenges merchants need to tackle on the fly. When these kinds of issues arise, merchants need a simple way to pause their stores on DoorDash, so they can ensure behind-the-scenes challenges don't result in avoidable cancellations.

### What are Avoidable Cancellations? [#what-are-avoidable-cancellations]

Avoidable cancellations are canceled orders that could have been prevented with a high-quality integration and dedicated operational training. Two types of avoidable cancellations that may occur without the Store Status Webhook are:

* **POS Cancellations**: When an order is automatically canceled because a store is not accepting orders.
* **Store Closed Cancellations**: When a Dasher cancels an order because the store is closed when they arrive.

### The Solution [#the-solution]

The Store Status Webhook lets merchants disable their stores when an unavoidable issue comes up, ensuring customers canâ€™t place an order a merchant is unable to fulfill.

To address a high rate of Store Closed cancellations, a fast food chain with thousands of locations implemented both a proactive and a reactive approach to notify DoorDash of unavoidable issues using the Store Status Webhook:

* **Automated Deactivation**: The fast food chain proactively checks store uptime to detect any intermittent changes to POS connectivity. After recognizing a change in online status, the integration automatically sends an update to DoorDash using the Store Status Webhook to pause the store.
* **Manual Deactivation**: The fast food chain allows store managers to manually pause the Online Ordering integration using internal tooling. After the operator executes the workflow to trigger the deactivation in-store, the integration sends an update to DoorDash using the Store Status Webhook.

### The Results [#the-results]

Thanks to their direct integration with the DoorDash OpenAPI, the fast food chain adopted the Store Status Webhook across 2404 stores, resulting in a 12.5% reduction in the number of POS cancellations from late May through August of 2023\*, and a statistically significant reduction in the number of Store Closed cancellations over the same period.

Through building and implementing the Store Status Webhook, the fast food chain reduced avoidable cancellations and by extension the negative customer experiences associated with canceled orders.
