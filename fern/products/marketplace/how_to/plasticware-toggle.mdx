## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

To allow Consumers on DoorDash Marketplace to accept or decline receiving single-use utensils/accessories at your store, the feature must be enabled at the store/business level by a DoorDash Technical Account Manager and the “Orders” Webhook Subscription must be built out on the Provider side to enable DoorDash to pass the value within the order confirmation payload body.

## Overview [#overview]

DoorDash has a toggle during checkout to allow Customers to opt-in or opt-out of receiving single-use accessories. DoorDash will include an additional boolean field *"is\_plastic\_ware\_option\_selected”* on the order payload to notify the Merchant operator of the Consumer’s plasticware selection.

## Get Started [#get-started]

### Step 1: Confirm your [Webhook Subscription setup](https://developer.doordash.com/portal/integration/marketplace/webhook_subscriptions) is complete [#step-1-confirm-your-webhook-subscription-setup-is-complete]

Verify the Endpoint URL defined for the “Orders” Event Type.


### Step 2: Identify the order payload model and the additional field **"is\_plastic\_ware\_option\_selected"**. [#step-2-identify-the-order-payload-model-and-the-additional-field-is_plastic_ware_option_selected]

### Step 3: Upon order injection, validate the field **"is\_plastic\_ware\_option\_selected"** [#step-3-upon-order-injection-validate-the-field-is_plastic_ware_option_selected]

Alert the store operator to include single-use accessories if the field is set to “true”. When the guest elects to include single-use accessories on their order, this value is often included on the Kitchen Display System and printed on receipts.

## Progress Check [#progress-check]

After the feature is enabled for your test store, a test order can be placed to validate that the **"is\_plastic\_ware\_option\_selected"** field is being sent within the order payload body and handled correctly downstream.

## Next Steps [#next-steps]

### Step 1 - POS Programming [#step-1---pos-programming]

Confirm if any additional programming is needed locally within the POS database to support the mapping of DoorDash’s plasticware field to the corresponding item/option within the Merchant’s environment.

### Step 2 - User Acceptance Testing [#step-2---user-acceptance-testing]

During testing, ensure that Consumer selection for single-use accessories is visible to the store operator downstream within POS/KDS.

### Step 3 - Deployment Planning [#step-3---deployment-planning]

Define feature deployment schedule with your DoorDash Technical Account Manager and verify successful implementation in Production during pilot period.

### Step 4 - Complete Rollout [#step-4---complete-rollout]

Ensure that functionality is enabled for all eligible stores under your provider.

## FAQs [#faqs]

### Why is DoorDash rolling out this new policy? [#why-is-doordash-rolling-out-this-new-policy]

Reducing our environmental footprint is important to DoorDash, and this new policy tracks environmental guidelines in specific cities in the United States.

### What do you mean by “plasticware”? [#what-do-you-mean-by-plasticware]

Plasticware includes utensils, straws, stirrers, sauces, and napkins. When an order
indicates “no silverware”, then no plasticware is needed.

### How will consumers select whether or not to include silverware? [#how-will-consumers-select-whether-or-not-to-include-silverware]

In each order, consumers select whether they want silverware. By default, silverware will
be excluded from their order. We anticipate the majority of your DoorDash orders will not
include silverware.

### Will Dashers know about this change? [#will-dashers-know-about-this-change]

Yes, we are communicating these changes to Dashers. Today, Dashers confirm whether
silverware is included and often pick up napkins. Specifically, Dashers will also see
whether consumers are selecting silverware in each order and adjust accordingly.

### Where does this new DoorDash program apply? [#where-does-this-new-doordash-program-apply]

The feature is currently available only in select geographies. More details [here](https://help.doordash.com/merchants/s/article/Single-Use-Accessories?language=en_US).

### If I don’t provide any silverware today, do I need to start? [#if-i-dont-provide-any-silverware-today-do-i-need-to-start]

If your orders do not require silverware today (e.g., pizza), you do not need to start
supplying silverware.
