## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to heading")

By default, all developers that have an active integration with DoorDash will be able to request information from our Get Menu endpoints. There are two endpoints that can be used to retrieve all active menus. Each endpoint has its own criteria detailed below:

**Onboarding Get Menu Endpoint ([SSIO](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/overview/onboarding/ssio/#prerequisite-developer-portal-sign-up) Merchants)**

* The store must have an active onboarding ID generated by our [Initialize Onboarding](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/overview/onboarding/ssio/#initialize-onboarding) endpoint

**Integrated Get Menu Endpoint (Configured Merchants)**

* The store must already be configured to your provider type and have an active connection with your environment.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to heading")

These two endpoints have been created to allow OpenAPI integrated partners to retrieve active menus associated with specific stores. Both of these endpoints serve the same purpose in providing partners with a JSON payload of a merchant’s active menus.

### Onboarding Get DoorDash Menu[​](#onboarding-get-doordash-menu "Direct link to heading")

#### Request URL[​](#request-url "Direct link to heading")

### Integrated Get Doordash Menu[​](#integrated-get-doordash-menu "Direct link to heading")
