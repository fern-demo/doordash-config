# Receiving menu status updates

Limited access

<Warning>
Marketplace APIs are not yet generally available. Please record interest in early access [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfggU_NjGWCdi9vyWUicrnzJmtu9vC4zgbfSC3ROwSvW4eV2g/viewform).
</Warning>

DoorDash has a webhook that will send status updates once your menu is finished processing. This is a required webhook and can be subscribed to within Developer Portal.

You will need to set this webhook up in Developer Portal by following our [Create a Webhook Subscription guide](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/create_webhook_subscription).

These requests will contain payloads with the following format:

```
{  
 "event": {  
   "type": "<MenuCreate> or <MenuUpdate>",  
   "status": "<SUCCESS> or <FAILURE>",  
   "reference": "<either a client-provided or automatically generated reference UUID>",  
   "details": "<String of information on why it failed. Provided only when it fails."  
 },  
  "store": {  
        "merchant_supplied_id": "<client's store id>"  
     },  
  "menu": {  
        "id": "<the UUID used to identify the menu id on DoorDash's end>"  
  }  
}  
  

```

Please save the `id` field as this will be needed to update the menu in the future. If the `id` field is returned in the Menu Status Notification, this means the core menu was successfully created. There can be situations where the `"status": "FAILURE"`, but the `id` is returned. This means that the menu was created successfully, but the store hours phase of menu creation failed. In this case, please save the `id` field to update the menu in the future and validate that the store hours are correct. Please avoid using a menu POST for the same menu as this will create duplicate menus.

The `details` field in the Menu Status Callback Webhook response body provides a simple, actionable failure reason, enabling external partners to understand why the menu job failed DoorDash validation.

Please go through all the required scenarios in the testing plan [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1es21nyRuVfX0oYi8XmWGx9G10_BbmemZICE6A8aO2Lo/edit?gid=969310481#gid=969310481) to validate you are receiving the `details` field successfully. To trigger menu pulls refer to this [guide](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/ingest_and_update_menus) on how to ingest and update menus using the Developer Portal.

Below are possible menu job failure reasons that may be returned in the `details` field:
