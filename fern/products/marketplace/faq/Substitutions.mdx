## Can I substitute an item that is not found in the menu / catalog? [#can-i-substitute-an-item-that-is-not-found-in-the-menu--catalog]

This is not possible because we rely on existing SKU data that’s found in the menu / catalog to process substitution requests. If the substitute isn’t found or active, the customer will be refunded for the original item price.

## How will customers be notified that their order is being substituted? [#how-will-customers-be-notified-that-their-order-is-being-substituted]

Customers will be notified of their substitutions via email and push notification.

## Can store operators speak with customers directly to discuss substitution options? [#can-store-operators-speak-with-customers-directly-to-discuss-substitution-options]

This requires the enablement of the masked phone number feature which will allow the customer to be contacted directly via phone or text from only the saved store number.

## What if there’s not a good replacement item to substitute? [#what-if-theres-not-a-good-replacement-item-to-substitute]

Best to remove the line item from the order which will trigger the customer’s refund.

## I can’t fulfill the original requested quantity, can I partially fulfill the initial item and substitute another item for the remaining quantity? [#i-cant-fulfill-the-original-requested-quantity-can-i-partially-fulfill-the-initial-item-and-substitute-another-item-for-the-remaining-quantity]

Our current substitution flow does not support this today. Please use either 'ITEM\_ADJUSTMENT' for the quantity of the initial item based on what your stock has available, or the 'ITEM\_SUBSTITUTE' instead.
