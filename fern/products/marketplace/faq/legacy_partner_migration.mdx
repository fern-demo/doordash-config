## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash has built the Developer Portal to enable Integration Partners to have a more hands-on experience where they can view/manage their Marketplace and Drive integrations from one central place.

Partners who were onboarded via the legacy Marketplace integration need to update their integration to meet our Developer Portal requirements to ensure the integration will continue to be supported.

## Required Updates Partners must complete[​](#required-updates-partners-must-complete "Direct link to heading")

1. Gain access to Developer Portal by following the appropriate [Migration Process](#migration-process)
2. Update integration hostname to [https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace](https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace)
3. Update URL Paths to the updated versions outlined [below](#updated-url-paths-for-migration)
4. Update to our new JWT authentication method outlined [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/JWTs/)

## Migration Process[​](#migration-process "Direct link to heading")

**The migration process is different for Partners who only have a DoorDash Marketplace integration versus Partners who have both DoorDash Marketplace AND DoorDash Drive integrations.**

To ensure your Migration to the Developer Portal goes smoothly, please follow the proper process that applies to you below:

* Marketplace **ONLY** Partners: Follow [this process](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/faq/marketplace_migration_steps)
* Marketplace **AND** Drive Partners: Follow [this process](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/faq/marketplace_and_drive_migration)

## Migration FAQs[​](#migration-faqs "Direct link to heading")

### How do I know if our integration is a Legacy integration that needs to be updated?[​](#how-do-i-know-if-our-integration-is-a-legacy-integration-that-needs-to-be-updated "Direct link to heading")

If you are using the Hostname [https://pointofsale.doordash.com](https://pointofsale.doordash.com), for your integration, you have a legacy integration that needs to be updated.

### Can we make the required updates in phases?[​](#can-we-make-the-required-updates-in-phases "Direct link to heading")

Some examples are:

1. Changing the Hostname and URL Paths but not using to JWT Auth yet
2. Updating an *x* amount of your Hostname and URL Paths one week and the other *x* amount another time
3. Updating to JWT Auth, but not updating the HostName or URL paths yet

Partners are able to make these changes in stages but **MUST** ensure that the **HostName** and **URL paths** are **updated together**.

For example, if a Partner updates their HostName for their [Activation Status endpoint](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/api/marketplace#tag/Store-Endpoints/operation/updateStoreStatus), they must also ensure that the URL path for this call is also updated.
If they mix the legacy hostname with the new URL paths, the calls will fail.

Correct:
[https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/stores/"{location_id}"/status](https://openapi.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/stores/%7Blocation_id%7D/status)

Incorrect:
[https://pointofsale.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/stores/{"{location_id}"}/status](https://pointofsale.doordash.com/marketplace/api/v1/stores/%7Blocation_id%7D/status)

### How do I know if I have fully updated my integration?[​](#how-do-i-know-if-i-have-fully-updated-my-integration "Direct link to heading")

When you have 100% successfully updated your integration, a Technical Account Manager will reach out to you and let you know that you have successfully updated all items including the Hostname, URL paths and JWT.

### Are changes required for the bearer token that is sent with the webhooks from DoorDash to the Partner environment?[​](#are-changes-required-for-the-bearer-token-that-is-sent-with-the-webhooks-from-doordash-to-the-partner-environment "Direct link to heading")

No, no changes are required. The changes needed here are strictly for calls to the Doordash API.

### What should I do if I submitted a support request to share my email, and I have not heard back?[​](#what-should-i-do-if-i-submitted-a-support-request-to-share-my-email-and-i-have-not-heard-back "Direct link to heading")

If you have submitted the email you used to kick off the migration process and have not heard anything, please reach out to your Technical Account Manager.

If you are not sure who your Technical Account Manager is, please submit another ticket by filling out this [form](https://doordash.workflowcloud.com/forms/2828c42d-8fe2-48a0-82dd-f036f8c76c0d) and using the ID 2305617399 for the field "DoorDash Store ID".

### What happens if I do not migrate before the deadline?[​](#what-happens-if-i-do-not-migrate-before-the-deadline "Direct link to heading")

Your integration will be at risk of losing core functionality and you will be unable to enjoy the benefits of our new Developer Portal.
If you have any questions or concerns with the deadline, please work with your Technical Account Manager.

## Updated URL Paths for Migration[​](#updated-url-paths-for-migration "Direct link to heading")
