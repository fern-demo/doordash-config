## What timezone should my ‘start\_time’ and ‘end\_time’ be? [#what-timezone-should-my-start_time-and-end_time-be]

The hours should be set based on the timezone of the restaurant/store.

## How can I send hours if my store is open overnight? [#how-can-i-send-hours-if-my-store-is-open-overnight]

## What causes a menu job to fail due to store hours? [#what-causes-a-menu-job-to-fail-due-to-store-hours]

DoorDash will fail the menu job if store hours fall into any of the following categories:

* Overlapping Hours across multiple days. For example, the below hours configuration where hours on Friday are `8:00 AM - 2:00 AM` and hours on Saturday are `1:00 AM - 10:00 PM`

```json
{  
    "day_index": "FRI",  
    "start_time": "08:00:00",  
    "end_time": "02:00:00"  
},  
{  
    "day_index": "SAT",  
    "start_time": "01:00:00",  
    "end_time": "22:00:00"  
}  

```

* Start Time = End Time and times are not 00:00

```json
{  
    "day_index": "FRI",  
    "start_time": "13:00:00",  
    "end_time": "13:00:00"  
}  

```

* Store Open Hours are less than 30 minutes

```json
{  
    "day_index": "FRI",  
    "start_time": "13:00:00",  
    "end_time": "13:20:00"  
}  

```

## How can I send hours if my store is closed? [#how-can-i-send-hours-if-my-store-is-closed]

If a store is closed on a particular day (like a holiday), please use Store Special Hours and set `closed = true`.

If a store is always closed on a particular day of the week, please use Store Open Hours and set `start_time = 00:00` and `end_time = 00:00` for that `day_index` or omit the `day_index` entirely.

If a store is temporarily closed on all days (renovation, etc), DoorDash Store Availability webhooks should be used to deactivate the store. Additional infromation on our Store Availability Webhook's can be found [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/store_and_item_status#store-activation-status-change).

## Why is my store on DoorDash closing earlier than the hours sent? [#why-is-my-store-on-doordash-closing-earlier-than-the-hours-sent]

This is a platform wide logic where we apply a buffer to all stores on the DoorDash site. This allows for food prep time, time for dasher arrival, etc. before the store actually closes.

## Can I set hours for a specific item? [#can-i-set-hours-for-a-specific-item]

Yes, there is capability to control hourly availability at an Item and Item Option Level, rather than a menu level. This information will be sent via our Menu API. Store Hours on a menu will remain the default availability if Item Hours are not defined. More details can be found [here](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/marketplace/how_to/item_level_hours).

## How can I set multiple open hour periods within the same day (mid-day closure)? [#how-can-i-set-multiple-open-hour-periods-within-the-same-day-mid-day-closure]

If your store needs to be open during two separate time periods in the same day, you will need to create two separate entries for the same `day_index` in your `open_hours` array when making an Update Menu API call.

```json
{  
    "day_index": "FRI",  
    "start_time": "9:00:00",  
    "end_time": "14:00:00"  
},  
{  
    "day_index": "FRI",  
    "start_time": "17:00:00",  
    "end_time": "22:00:00"  
}  

```
