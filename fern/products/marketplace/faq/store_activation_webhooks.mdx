## What will happen if a store is already deactivated and a deactivation webhook is sent? [#what-will-happen-if-a-store-is-already-deactivated-and-a-deactivation-webhook-is-sent]

DoorDash will return a 200 response and the store will remain deactivated.

## I am trying to reactivate a store, but the request is failing. Why? [#i-am-trying-to-reactivate-a-store-but-the-request-is-failing-why]

DoorDash has several validations in place for store activation. If any of these conditions are not met, the Store Activation request will fail. This usually requires manual intervention to properly configure the store. Examples of validations are **(1)** store must have one active menu and **(2)** store must have valid banking information.
