## Can I adjust orders using my system’s unique identifier that is sent back on order confirmation?[​](#can-i-adjust-orders-using-my-systems-unique-identifier-that-is-sent-back-on-order-confirmation "Direct link to heading")

No, we can only accept order adjustments referencing the DoorDash order UUID.

## Can I adjust orders/modifiers using my system’s unique identifier (Merchant Supplied ID) of the product that is sent in the menu?[​](#can-i-adjust-ordersmodifiers-using-my-systems-unique-identifier-merchant-supplied-id-of-the-product-that-is-sent-in-the-menu "Direct link to heading")

No. We need our integration partners to maintain the new unique ID of the item and option line items so we can process the cancellation or adjustment for the correct product.

While you will receive an “OK” when carrying out this function, the cart will not be adjusted. Please use the order cancellation endpoint instead.
