## What will happen if an item/item option is marked out of stock and a deactivation webhook is sent?​[​](#what-will-happen-if-an-itemitem-option-is-marked-out-of-stock-and-a-deactivation-webhook-is-sent "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash will return a 200 Success response and the item will remain deactivated.

## What happens when an item is in-stock and an item activation webhook is sent?[​](#what-happens-when-an-item-is-in-stock-and-an-item-activation-webhook-is-sent "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash will return a 200 Success response and the item will remain active.

## If an Item exists multiple times in my menu what is the expected response if I send the merchant\_supplied\_id only once?​[​](#if-an-item-exists-multiple-times-in-my-menu-what-is-the-expected-response-if-i-send-the-merchant_supplied_id-only-once "Direct link to heading")

DoorDash will return a 200 Success response for each time the item was successfully deactivated within the menu

## What happens if I had an item 1 modifier and I only mark the modifier out of stock?[​](#what-happens-if-i-had-an-item-1-modifier-and-i-only-mark-the-modifier-out-of-stock "Direct link to heading")

If the modifier is required, the item will be deactivated.

If the modifier is not required, the item will remain active, but the out of stock modifier will remain hidden.

## What happens if I deactivate an item through the item activation endpoint? Can I reactivate it using a menu update request?[​](#what-happens-if-i-deactivate-an-item-through-the-item-activation-endpoint-can-i-reactivate-it-using-a-menu-update-request "Direct link to heading")

No. the two requests deactivate items in a different manner. The item activation/deactivation request acts as a suspension of a specific item, whereas a menu update marking the item as inactive will affect the existence of the item.

If you mark an item as inactive via a menu push you will need to activate it through a menu push.

If you mark an item as inactive via our item/item option activation endpoints you must reactivate it using the same endpoints.

## How can I activate or deactivate an item based on hours?[​](#how-can-i-activate-or-deactivate-an-item-based-on-hours "Direct link to heading")
