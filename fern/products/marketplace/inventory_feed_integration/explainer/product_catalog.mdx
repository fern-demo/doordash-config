The main driver of the images, names, and descriptions of these products is the Product Catalog. DoorDash has a dedicated team to build out the partner’s Catalog. Products are separated into collections and broken down into categories with associated tags & variants. The Catalog is built based on the Catalog File provided by the Merchant, with additional inputs from internal and 3rd party sources to create a rich customer experience. When a new item is added to the catalog post-launch, it can take time to include within the platform.



### Discoverability & Collections[​](#discoverability--collections "Direct link to heading")

Customers discover items in 3 main ways: Collections, Category Pages, and Search. Below is a detailed description of each as well as a visual guide.

1. **Collections** are a custom group of items to be displayed on the storefront for increased visibility of important items / limited time offers / promotions. DoorDash has a list of relevant Collections and has a team working on Seasonal Collections that will automatically surface. However, our team does take Merchant input and is happy to create custom Collections for you. Ask your Account Owner for a list of Collections we use, feel free to send over a list of Items, and your Account Owner can develop a cadence for updating these for you.
2. **Categories** are groupings by “categorical level”, optimized for browsing & user friendliness (clicking into “Drinks” will display all drink items only). Category Pages are defined by the vertical of the merchant (Grocery, Convenience, Alcohol, Retail, Pets, etc.).
3. **Store Level Search** allows a user to search for a specific item within a store. The search experience is optimized by machine learning and search results improve over time based on successful and unsuccessful searches.

### Catalog Feed Setup[​](#catalog-feed-setup "Direct link to heading")

To more easily maintain the product catalog as products are added and removed, DoorDash requests a recurring transfer of the entire catalog file. The file should be transferred via SFTP with the following requirements:

* File Type: Flat file (CSV)
* File Naming Convention: catalog\_{yyyy}{mm}{dd}{hh}{mm}.csv
* Transfer Path: catalog/v1
* File Cadence: At least monthly, but daily or weekly transfers are encouraged

This file will be used for adding new items to the catalog. For example, if a new item enters the Inventory Feed, the DD team will look to the catalog file sent by the Merchant to pull in the fields needed to effectively build the SKU (image, brand, item name, UPC, etc.). It is therefore important that any items in the Inventory Feed are present in the catalog file. Please work with your Account Owner to understand the cadence at which your catalog will be updated on the DoorDash platform. If priority SKUs need to be added quickly (for a seasonal holiday, for example), please send these SKUs to your Account Owner in an email and we will be happy to get these SKUs live and merchandised as quickly as possible.

DD does not currently have an automated process for updating attributes for existing SKUs, outside of price & availability. Rich fields (item name, description, image, brand, ingredients, UPC, etc.) are not automatically added to DD’s catalog if the merchant updates their catalog file.
