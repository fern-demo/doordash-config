The Inventory Feed file represents a store-level data export that contains all of the pricing and availability information for each sellable item. This data is used to create or update the store’s menu on DoorDash Marketplace and dictate the visible items and their associated prices & taxes.

This information is shared with DoorDash at least daily (max 3x per day). When a new file is detected, the ETL transformation will begin automatically to align the file with our processor’s standard format. Once the ETL process completes, a webhook is sent to our internal processor that kicks off the Menu update. This process generally takes 2-4 hours to complete but can extend depending on the amount of data received.



## Sample File Requirements [#sample-file-requirements]

To kickoff an Integration build, DoorDash requires a sample of the file that will be used as the Inventory Feed. Ideally inventory data will be sent in the format outlined under ‘Inventory Feed Setup’, however these are not strict requirements. If you are unable to meet these requirements, please work with your Technical Account Manager to align on a path forward. We will build the ETL logic based on this sample, so ensure that the production file you intend to send matches this format.

## Inventory Feed Setup [#inventory-feed-setup]

Once your sample file has been approved, DoorDash requires a daily, automated transfer of the file to our SFTP server. The following expectations are in place for Inventory Feeds:

* File Type: Flat file (CSV)
* File Naming Convention: inventory\_{yyyy}{mm}{dd}{hh}{MM}.csv
* Transfer Path: daily\_feed/v1/{yyyy}{mm}{dd}
* File Cadence: Minimum daily refresh of Inventory Feed data (availability & pricing). This process should be automated and occur on a set scheduled time.
